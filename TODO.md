    - [x] Serialize to JSON
    - [x] Deserialize from JSON
    - [x] Implement undo
    - [x] Export to JSON
    - [x] Import from JSON
    - [x] Add unit tests
    - [x] Display count of available moves
    - [x] Dropping cards on reserves, freecells, cascades is difficult
    - [x] Undo doesn't update avail. moves
    - [x] Detect win
    - [x] Autoplay
    - [x] Stack moves
    - [x] Undo of automoves is not possible currently
    - [x] Animations (moving cards)
    - [x] Cascade labels
    - [x] Move by keyboard input
    - [x] Undo is messed up (particularly if keyboard moves involved).
    - [x] Add validate function to rules, call after every move
    - [x] Rework menu (everything is under File now and it doesn't make sense)
    - [x] After return animation, card still has "selected" effect
    - [x] Reset to reserves "bounces"
    - [x] Colorize selected card effect erases color so you can't immediately tell if it's a black or red card
    - [x] When dragging from cascade to foundations, dragged card is at lower z-level than cards higher than ace
    - [x] Some cards in the foundations are left highlighted somehow
    - [x] When autoplay finishes, it usually only makes it to Q
    - [ ] Foolproof way of determining when the game is won (i.e., don't interrupt final automoves animations)
